# isce_sat2

`isce_sat2` is a project to explore the data fusion possibilities between the ICESat-2 space-based lidar, UAVSAR, and future NISAR based L-band InSAR for snow water storage measurements.

## Research Motivations

1. How can ICESat-2 improve our ability to use UAVSAR/NISAR?
2. Can we combine these instruments to improve our ability to estimate snow water storage?
3. Learn more about our respective instruments and get to work together!

## What are UAVSAR and ICESat-2?

[UAVSAR](https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/education/what-is-uavsar.html) is a low frequency plane-based synthetic aperature radar. UAVSAR stands for "Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperature Radar". It captures imagery using a L-band radar. This low frequency means it can penetrate into and through clouds, vegetation, and snow.

## Specific Questions

1. Can we use ICESat-2 to constrain phase change in UAVSAR pairs?
2. How well do ICESat-2 snow depths compare to UAVSAR?
3. How often does ICESat-2 intersect with itself and UAVSAR image pairs?
4. Is this kind of comparison scaleable?
5. How does UAVSAR coherence compare with ICESat-2 confidence?
